  - HELLO, MY SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER INTERN. WELCOME TO YOUR NEW JOB.
  - YOUR RESPONSIBILITY HERE IS TO TRANSLATE MY THOUGHTS INTO QUACKS ON QUACKER.COM
    WORD-BY-WORD.
  - NOW, YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSED ABOUT MY EMAIL REGARDING OUR KEYBOARD CIRCUMSTANCES.
    ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.
  - OUR COMPUTERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART ANTI-HACKING SOFTWARE.
  - ALL OUR KEYBOARDS' LAYOUTS ARE RANDOMIZED, SO NO ONE CAN RECORD THE CONTENT WE'RE
    TYPING.
  - THE LAST INTERN CREATED A HANDY MANUAL TO HELP YOU FIND THE KEYBOARD LAYOUT.
    YOU SHOULD USE IT AS A REFERENCE.
  - IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YET, DOWNLOAD THE PDF FILE ON THIS PAGE.
  - BEFORE TYPING EACH QUACK, YOU CAN TYPE "QWERTY" ON YOUR KEYBOARD, LOOK AT THE
    RESULT AND FIND THE MATCHING TABLE.
  - REMEMBER THAT IT'S A HIGH PAYING JOB, SO I EXPECT YOU TO SEND THEM ON A TIMELY
    MANNER AND GET BETTER OVER TIME.
  - BUT DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE. EACH MISTAKE YOU MAKE IS A CUT ON YOUR PAYCHEQUE.
  - MAKE TOO MANY MISTAKES, THEN YOU'RE OUTTA HERE. ARE YOU READY?
