  - HEY INTERN. I'M QUITE IMPRESSED BY YOUR WORK SO FAR.
  - IN MY OPINION, THIS ENTRY LEVEL JOB IS NO LONGER A BEST FIT FOR YOU.
  - THAT'S WHY WE'RE LETTING YOU GO.
  - I JUST RECEIVED THE TYPING ROBOT I PREORDERED A MONTH AGO THAT CAN DO EXACTLY
    YOUR JOB.
  - IT'S GONNA BE FASTER, MORE ACCURATE, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, CHEAPER. ISN'T IT
    EXCITING?
  - PLEASE PACK YOUR STUFF AND LEAVE WITHIN AN HOUR SO I WON'T WASTE ANY MORE MONEY
    ON YOU.
