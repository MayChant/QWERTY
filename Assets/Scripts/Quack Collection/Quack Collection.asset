  - We're now the only 7.6 billion people left on earth. People aren't talking enough
    about this.
  - People can easily get out of homelessness by investing in real estates, yet so
    few of them are doing it. Curious.
  - I just came to the worrying realization that our next generation is not nearly
    as old as we are.
  - Elevators should not be able to keep their jobs. They don't even elevate you
    half the time. Disappointing.
  - I don't understand why anyone would need coffee. Simply get enough sleep until
    you're ready for the day.
  - I Asked an artist to draw me a portrait for free but he refused. He could've
    gotten so much exposure.
  - Quacker has such a cesspool of toxic users. If you disagree with me, just be
    polite and be quiet.
  - I'm jealous of young people today. They can gain so much experience working multiple
    jobs at the same time.
  - Data shows that a lot of people died after getting into contact with H2O, but
    scientists could not care less.
  - Do people really want housing prices to go down instead of working harder to
    be able to afford it? Seriously?
  - When a snake swallows a whole sausage of the same length, it becomes the new
    sausage itself.
  - Back in my days, I had to store my cash by piling them up in my house like a
    low wall. A wallet, if you may.
  - I discovered that you can prevent dropping your spoon by not holding them by
    yourself. Isn't it amazing?
  - Quacker needs to take action and ban the fake news. I do in fact have a left
    eye. Stop spreading lies.
  - Butterflies are spy drones sent by the government. Need proof? Ever seen a baby
    butterfly? I don't think so.
  - How is world hunger still a thing? People can always grow their own food in their
    own field.
  - Who cares if sea level rises a few feet? Couldn't people just sell their seaside
    houses and leave?
  - My follower told me I'm almost as sharp as Tardigrades. I don't know this Tardigrades
    guy, but good for him.
  - I started my career with a measly inheritance of half a billion. If you stop
    complaining, you can do the same.
  - I don't get people who complain about public transport but keep taking them anyways.
    Just hire a driver.
