  - We're now the only 7.6 billion people left on earth. People aren't talking enough
    about this.
  - People can easily get out of homelessness by investing in real estates, yet so
    few of them are doing it. Curious.
  - I just came to the worrying realization that our next generation is not nearly
    as old as we are.
  - Elevators should not be able to keep their jobs. They don't even elevate you
    half the time. Disappointing.
  - I don't understand why anyone would need coffee. Simply get enough sleep until
    you're ready for the day.
  - I Asked an artist to draw me a portrait for free but he refused. He could've
    gotten so much exposure.
  - Quacker has such a cesspool of toxic users. If you disagree with me, just be
    polite and be quiet.
  - 'I''m so jealous of young people these days. I didn''t have the same luxury to
    work overtime everyday. '
  - Data shows that a lot of people died after getting into contact with H2O, but
    scientists could not care less.
  - Do people really want housing prices to go down instead of working harder to
    be able to afford it? Seriously?
